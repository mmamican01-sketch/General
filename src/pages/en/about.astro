    <p>
      ALFArhan General Trading Co. is an independent, compliance-led intermediary focused on
      connecting institutional and wholesale buyers with qualified counterparties in the
      international agri-commodities market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our primary scope is grains and sunflower oil with a particular orientation toward Russia
      and Ukraine origins, working only within the boundaries of applicable international
      regulations, sanctions frameworks, and internal risk policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALFArhan operates on a buyer-first basis. Our role is limited to coordinating information
      flows, documentation, and transaction execution steps between parties, while maintaining
      a clear separation of responsibilities and decision-making on the buyer and seller side.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not own inventory, do not take title to goods at any stage of the chain, and do not
      operate on an exclusivity basis with any party. We do not warehouse, store, or physically
      handle commodities; instead, we focus on process integrity, transparency, and alignment
      between counterparties.
    </p>
    <p>
      All commercial parameters — including pricing structures, shipment schedules, and payment
      arrangements — are defined directly in the contractual documentation between the parties
      and remain subject to internal compliance, legal, and risk review.
